# Shop Shop Using Redux


## Description
This is a task tracking site that was created using React and Apollo Provider.  Happy Tails v2.0 serves the same purpose as the original Happy Tails site, but includes added features and improved performance.  This site is currently hosted on Heroku at [Heroku Deployment](https://happytails-v2.herokuapp.com/https://happytails-v2.herokuapp.com/) and can also be run locally using the files located in the GitHub repository [Github](https://github.com/es2013/happy-tails).  To learn how to run this server locally please continue reading the [Installation](#installation) and [Usage](#usage) sections.

## Usage

To use this app you must first create a user account.  Navigate to the hompage using the link found in the [Description](#description) section and click login.  This will direct you to a login page which has an additional link for signup.  Once you have entered the correct info in the signup form you will be directed to your dashboard where you can view all dogs, update a dog's activities, and filter dogs by category.  

If you would like to test this application using an admin login account, please contact us.

As an admin user you will be able to make additional actions and have access to exclusive pages and data.  The admin user will be able to add dogs, view user info, and activate or de-activate users.  

If you wish to run the application on local host first follow all instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.  To seed the data navigate to the server.js file in the server directory.  Towards the middle of the file there will be a block of code commented out with instructions on how to seed the database above it.  Once your database is seeded and node modules are installed you can run the command "npm start" from the root directory and the page will open automatically in your default browser. 

Here are some screenshots and gifs of the application's functionality:
